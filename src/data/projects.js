Data was scraped from YouTube using Google Cloud Console API, followed by text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization). A Naive Bayes model was trained with CountVectorizer and deployed using pickle. A real-time Streamlit dashboard was built for sentiment analysis, featuring interactive word clouds and visualizations.",
